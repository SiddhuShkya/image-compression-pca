# Image Compression using pca (Principle component analysis)

Image compression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that reduces the size of an image file by representing the image data in a lower-dimensional space. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that aims to capture the most significant information from the data by identifying the principal components, which are the directions of maximum variance.
